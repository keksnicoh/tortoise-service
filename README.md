# turtle-service

As we host tortoises on our balcony we must ensure that the thermal properties of their home classify habitable.
Sensor data, [comming from a raspberry pi][1], allows to monitor the terrarium.
Manual or automatic actions can be triggered to control the environment (turn on/off light bulp, ...)
