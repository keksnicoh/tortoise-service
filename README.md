# turtle-service

as we host turtles on our balcony we must ensure that the thermal properties of their home classify habitable.
we use a raspberry pi to collect sensor data (temperature, humidity, infra red array, camera pictures, ...).
the data is send to this service in order to provide information / push notifications to an app as well as trigger interactions to fix environmental issues (i.e.: temperature exceed threshold, then turn of the UV-light bulp).
